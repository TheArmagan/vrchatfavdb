## Why?
The main reason for this project is the maximum limit of 50 avatars that can be favorited in VRChat.
I developed this project to exceed this limit and not to lose the avatars I favorited.


## Features
- Easily import your avatars you favorited in VRChat.
- Save as many avatars as you want.
- Set a custom avatar preview for your avatars.
- Add a notes to your avatars.
- Set your avatar directly in the game from the browser.


## To Start the App
1. To start the app you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Clone the repository to your machine.
3. Open a terminal in the project directory and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm run start` to start the app.
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/app`.

## Extra
- All your avatar data was stored at `public/avatars` and `public/avatar_images` folders. You can backup your data by copying these folders.
